# ADR-{D|I}-XXXX: {Decision title}

<!-- Two tracks (design D / implementation I) with per-track numbering are the default; a repository may collapse to a single track. IDs are never reused. -->

## Context and Problem Statement
{What problem, risk, or design pressure makes this decision necessary? Keep this concrete.}

## Decision Drivers
- {driver 1}
- {driver 2}

## Decision
{State the decision directly.}

## Product / Philosophy Relevance
{Optional. Use when the decision protects the project's core philosophy or product intent. Omit or shorten for purely implementation-level ADRs.}

## Implementation Impact
{Optional. Use when the decision affects API shape, storage, tests, migrations, performance, or operational behavior. Omit or shorten for high-level design ADRs.}

## Considered Options
1. {Option A}
2. {Option B — a clean one-line description; rejection reasoning goes below, not inline.}

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **{Option X}**. {Explain why this option best satisfies the decision drivers.}

### Rejected Alternatives
{One paragraph per rejected option: why it was rejected. When the option is likely to be re-proposed, also state the evidence or condition that would legitimately reopen it; when it is rejected outright, say so. Omit the section only when no rejection needs explaining.}

## Consequences
- Positive: {positive consequence}
- Negative / tradeoffs: {tradeoff}

## Decision Boundary
{Optional. Format the parts visually separately — one line or paragraph each, sized to their content.}

Invariant: {what changing requires a superseding ADR; include a deliberately bounded scope and its rationale here — the guard against wrongly extending the decision.}

Not covered: {calibrated defaults and free surfaces that may change through measured configuration or a plan record.}

## Measurement Basis
{Optional. For empirically grounded decisions: the corpus, configuration, and provenance behind the numbers; scope limits; a reproducibility pointer. Evidence alone does not warrant an ADR.}

## Validation
{How will implementation or review prove this decision is being followed? Examples: schema checks, compile-time types, integration tests, migration tests, documentation review.}

## Revisit When
{State the premise whose expiry reopens the decision — this section is what makes legitimate reversal safe instead of wrongly preserving the decision.}

## Consultation impact
{Optional, one line: question asked, ruling adopted or rejected, unresolved dissent.}

## More Information
{Optional links to related ADRs, issues, experiments, or evidence.}
